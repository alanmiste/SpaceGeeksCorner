 <font size="5"> **Why?**</font> 

 <font size="5">In my free time I design photos, and sometimes the design takes a long time, so I always wished it would be easier. Hence the idea to create an application that creates designs in the fewest steps possible, and I don't think there is less than one click.
And since I'm a space geek, I couldn't find a better than space photo to be the hero of this app.
</font>
 <font size="5"> **What?!**</font> 
 <font size="5">It is an application that allows viewing of various images fetched from NASA via its API. The logged in user can add photos to his favourites or delete them if he no longer wants them. He can also create T-shirts Mockup from the photos he likes with just one click!</font> 

<font size="5"> **How?!**</font> 
 <font size="5">Using the following techniques I was able to create this application:
`Java` `Spring` `Maven` `Typescript` `React` `HTML` `CSS` `MongoDB` `Git/Github` `Docker` `Heroku` `CI/CD` `Junit` `Mocking` `SonarCloud` `RestAPI` 
</font> 


## API
**NASA API**  and **Printful API**
 you can read more about it in the  [Space Geeks Corner wiki](https://github.com/alanmiste/SpaceGeeksCorner/wiki) ).


## Available

The project is available on the link below via Heroku: <br>
[Live Link](https://spacegeekscorner.herokuapp.com)
> **Note:** Within the free Heroku hosting service, the application is put to sleep about half an hour after the last activity, so it may take a few seconds to work sometimes.

## Installation

-   Clone the project with this link: `git@github.com:alanmiste/SpaceGeeksCorner.git` 
    
-   Run  `npm install`  in frontend folder.
    
-   Allow installation of backend packages (if needed).
- The app needs to connect to **mongodb** database via **Homebrew** or a **Docker** container.
- Open **MongoDB-Compass** and connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`.  
    
-   Start backend application.
    
-   Start frontend application.

- Create a database named `sgcdb`.  
    
- Create a collection named "appUser"
    
-   The App will run on  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)  in the browser.
