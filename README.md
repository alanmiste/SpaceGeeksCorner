Since I am interested in programming, space and design, through this application I try to combine my interests.
The application will display images from space fetched by the **NASA API** ( you can read more about it in the [Space
Geeks Corner wiki](https://github.com/alanmiste/SpaceGeeksCorner/wiki) ).

The user can read some information about the pictures, and he can add the pictures he likes to favorites, and he will
also be able to transfer the pictures to the store to be printed on a T-shirt, for example, to be able to order it.
